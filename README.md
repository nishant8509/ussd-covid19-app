# USSD Based COVID-19 Helpdesk 

## Idea Description

- India and whole world is facing a huge problem of COVID19 outbreak, and government is taking essential steps to stop the chain reaction (spreading) of this virus. In this order world's largest lockdown has been announced by the government and many areas has been locked for about three weeks.
In this situation many software developers are creating applications so that every person can get essential sevices at their doorsteps and notify them to take precautions against this virus.
but there is problem which we don't focus on......
As we know India is the second largest populated country in the world, but still the share of smartphone users in India is less than 40% .
so providing smartphone apps to all the citizens of the country becomes difficult as there are many users who use basic phones or live in areas where internet connection is very weak.
#### So i've come up with an idea to use USSD(Unstructured, Supplementary Service Data) protocol to provide essential help-lines to those who have basic phone or have internet connectivity problem in their area which is free and user friendly.

## Software Requirement

- For the development of this USSD application sofware requires are :

1. `Africa's Talking` android app from Google Playstore or use the web interface at https://simulator.africastalking.com:1517/
2  `heroku CLI` (a simplified cloud deployment service) by following this link https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli or use online simulator
3. `Git Bash` Pushing code to the Heroku master branch for deployment
4. `Sublime text` text editor

## Process Flow
